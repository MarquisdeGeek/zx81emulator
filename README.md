## About

This is an emulator written using the EMF system, described at em.ulat.es

It contains the EMF framework, machine-generated libraries for the Zilog Z80 processor, and the specifc ZX81 code to make a working emulator. It also requires the open source version of the SGX library from https://github.com/MarquisdeGeek/sgx-actionscript


## Disclaimer

This code was written in 2011. It is now 2018. I have no way of ensuring that it builds, or is even useful. It is provided as a historical document, although I am always happy to help support all of my projects should someone find a use for/problem with the code!
